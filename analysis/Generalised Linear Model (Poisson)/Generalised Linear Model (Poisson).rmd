# Poisson GLM Models - Brief Report

## Objectives
Two count prediction models:
1. Predict number of courses approved in 1st semester
2. Predict number of courses approved in 2nd semester

## Model Type
Generalized Linear Model with Poisson family (for count data)

## Performance Metrics

### Model 1: 1st Semester Approved Courses
- R² Score: 0.478
- RMSE: 2.32 courses
- MAE: 1.62 courses

### Model 2: 2nd Semester Approved Courses
- R² Score: 0.728
- RMSE: 1.64 courses
- MAE: 1.14 courses

## Key Predictors

### 1st Semester Model (Top 3)
1. Tuition Fees Up to Date (Rate Ratio: 1.50 - increases expected courses by 49.5%)
2. Scholarship Holder (Rate Ratio: 1.20 - increases by 19.6%)
3. Courses Enrolled (Rate Ratio: 1.16 per course - increases by 15.5%)

### 2nd Semester Model (Top 3)
1. 1st Semester Grade (Rate Ratio: 1.16 per point - increases by 16.0%)
2. 1st Semester Approved (Rate Ratio: 1.09 per course - increases by 9.1%)
3. Tuition Fees Up to Date (Rate Ratio: 1.33 - increases by 33.0%)

## Dataset
- Total samples: 4,424 students (both models)
- Training: 3,539 students
- Test: 885 students
- Features: 13 (1st semester), 11 (2nd semester)

## Rate Ratio Interpretation
Rate ratio of 1.50 means: students with tuition paid have 50% higher expected course approval count than those who have not paid.

## Advantages Over Linear Regression
- Predictions always non-negative (count data cannot be negative)
- Properly models discrete count distribution
- More appropriate for integer outcomes
- Accounts for mean-variance relationship in count data

## Use Cases
- Academic planning and course load recommendations
- Resource allocation based on expected course completion
- Early warning systems for students at risk of approving fewer courses
- Policy impact assessment for financial aid programs

## Limitations
- Assumes mean equals variance (data shows slight overdispersion)
- May underestimate for high counts
- Requires sufficient sample size per count level

## Note on Overdispersion
The data shows variance greater than mean (9.57 vs 4.71 for approved courses), suggesting Negative Binomial GLM might provide better fit for future refinement.
