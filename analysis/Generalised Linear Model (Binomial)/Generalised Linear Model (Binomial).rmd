# Binomial GLM Models - Brief Report

## Objectives
Two binary classification models:
1. Predict high vs low admission scores
2. Predict graduate vs dropout outcomes

## Model Type
Generalized Linear Model with Binomial family (Logistic Regression)

## Performance Metrics

### Model 1: High vs Low Admission
- Accuracy: 70.4%
- AUC-ROC: 0.803
- Balanced precision and recall

### Model 2: Graduate vs Dropout
- Accuracy: 85.5%
- AUC-ROC: 0.920
- Recall for graduates: 93%

## Key Predictors

### Admission Model (Top 3)
1. Previous Qualification Grade (Odds Ratio: 4.39)
2. Application Order (Odds Ratio: 0.86)
3. Displaced Status (Odds Ratio: 1.09)

### Success Model (Top 3)
1. 1st Semester Approved Courses (Odds Ratio: 3.58)
2. Tuition Fees Up to Date (Odds Ratio: 2.64)
3. Scholarship Holder (Odds Ratio: 1.65)

## Dataset

### Admission Model
- Total samples: 4,424 students
- Training: 3,539 students
- Test: 885 students
- Features: 9 variables

### Success Model
- Total samples: 3,630 students (graduates and dropouts only)
- Training: 2,904 students
- Test: 726 students
- Features: 14 variables

## Odds Ratio Interpretation
An odds ratio of 3.58 means: for each additional approved course in 1st semester, the odds of graduating increase by 258%.

## Use Cases
- Admission model: Classification of applicant quality
- Success model: Early identification of at-risk students for intervention

## Limitations
- Binary outcomes only (cannot predict intermediate states like "enrolled")
- Assumes linear relationships in log-odds space
- Requires balanced classes for optimal performance
