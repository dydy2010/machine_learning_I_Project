# Linear Regression Model - Brief Report

## Objective
Predict exact 2nd semester grade values based on student characteristics and 1st semester performance.

## Model Type
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression

## Performance Metrics
- R² Score: 0.347
- RMSE: 1.10 grade points
- MAE: 0.86 grade points

## Interpretation
The model explains 35% of grade variation. On average, predictions are within 0.86 grade points of actual values.

## Key Predictors (Top 3)
1. 1st Semester Grade (coefficient: +0.52) - strongest predictor
2. 1st Semester Approved Courses (coefficient: +0.39)
3. Admission Grade (coefficient: +0.17)

## Dataset
- Total samples: 3,554 students
- Training set: 2,843 students
- Test set: 711 students
- Features: 13 variables

## Use Case
Appropriate for predicting continuous grade values when exact numerical predictions are required. Best used for academic counseling and grade projections.

## Limitations
- Assumes linear relationships between variables
- Explains only 35% of variance (other factors not in model affect grades)
- Cannot capture non-linear patterns
