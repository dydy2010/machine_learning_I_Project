# Executive Summary

**Problem Statement:** Higher education institutions face significant challenges with student retention. Understanding which students are at risk of dropping out enables timely interventions that can change academic trajectories.

**Our Approach:** We analyzed 4,424 students from a Portuguese higher education institution using five complementary machine learning techniques to predict student outcomes (Dropout, Enrolled, Graduate) and understand the factors that drive academic success.

**Key Findings:** 
- 1st semester performance is the strongest predictor of graduation
- Financial stability (tuition fees up to date) dramatically increases graduation odds
- Non-linear patterns exist in student success that traditional models miss
- Different models reveal different aspects of the dropout phenomenon

**Business Impact:** These models enable institutions to identify at-risk students early, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted intervention programs.

# 1. Introduction & Data Context

## 1.1 Motivation

Student dropout is a critical issue in higher education with consequences for:
- **Students:** Lost time, financial burden, and psychological impact
- **Institutions:** Revenue loss, reduced graduation rates, reputational damage
- **Society:** Lost human capital and economic potential

By predicting dropout risk early, institutions can intervene with:
- Academic support programs
- Financial aid counseling
- Mental health services
- Personalized study plans

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

## 2.1 Target Variable Distribution

```{r target-distribution, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Target, fill = Target)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = after_stat(count)), vjust = -0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Dropout" = "#E74C3C", 
                                "Enrolled" = "#F39C12", 
                                "Graduate" = "#27AE60")) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Student Outcomes",
       x = "Outcome", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

**Key Observation:** The dataset is reasonably balanced with a slight majority of graduates, reflecting the institution's overall success rate.

## 2.2 Critical Predictors: 1st Semester Performance

```{r first-sem-analysis, fig.height=5}
# Filter complete cases for visualization
data_clean <- data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Curricular.units.1st.sem..grade.))

ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = Curricular.units.1st.sem..approved., 
                       y = Curricular.units.1st.sem..grade., 
                       color = Target)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE, linewidth = 1.2) +  # Smoothers, not regression lines!
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Dropout" = "#E74C3C", 
                                 "Enrolled" = "#F39C12", 
                                 "Graduate" = "#27AE60")) +
  labs(title = "1st Semester Performance by Outcome (with LOESS smoothers)",
       x = "Number of Approved Courses (1st Semester)",
       y = "Average Grade (1st Semester)",
       color = "Outcome") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

**Insight:** Clear separation between outcomes. Graduates consistently have higher grades and more approved courses. Non-linear patterns suggest need for flexible models.

## 2.3 Financial & Socioeconomic Factors

```{r financial-factors, fig.height=4}
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Target, fill = as.factor(Tuition.fees.up.to.date))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("0" = "#E74C3C", "1" = "#27AE60"),
                    labels = c("Not Up to Date", "Up to Date")) +
  labs(title = "Tuition Fee Status by Outcome",
       x = "Outcome", y = "Proportion", fill = "Tuition Fees") +
  theme_minimal()

p2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Target, fill = as.factor(Scholarship.holder))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("0" = "#95A5A6", "1" = "#3498DB"),
                    labels = c("No Scholarship", "Scholarship")) +
  labs(title = "Scholarship Status by Outcome",
       x = "Outcome", y = "Proportion", fill = "Scholarship") +
  theme_minimal()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

**Insight:** Financial stability (tuition fees up to date) strongly correlates with graduation. Scholarships also show positive association with success.

## 2.4 Age Distribution

```{r age-distribution, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Age.at.enrollment, fill = Target)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Dropout" = "#E74C3C", 
                                "Enrolled" = "#F39C12", 
                                "Graduate" = "#27AE60")) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Student Outcome",
       x = "Age at Enrollment", y = "Density", fill = "Outcome") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

**Insight:** Younger students (traditional college age) have higher graduation rates. Non-traditional students face additional dropout risk.

# 3. Modeling Approach & Strategy

## 3.1 Model Selection Rationale

We employ five complementary modeling techniques, each revealing different aspects of student success:

| Model | Purpose | Strengths | Person |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Linear Regression** | Predict continuous grade values | Interpretable, establishes baseline | A |
| **GLM (Binomial)** | Binary outcomes (e.g., Pass/Fail, High/Low) | Odds ratios, probabilistic interpretation | A |
| **GLM (Poisson)** | Count outcomes (e.g., number of failed courses) | Handles count data, prevents negative predictions | A |
| **GAM** | Flexible non-linear relationships | Captures complex patterns, still interpretable | A |
| **Neural Networks** | Complex pattern recognition | Handles interactions, high predictive power | B |
| **SVM** | High-dimensional classification | Robust to outliers, kernel tricks for non-linearity | C |

## 3.2 Research Questions

Each model addresses specific questions:

1. **Linear Regression:** How do student characteristics linearly predict academic performance?
2. **GLM (Binomial):** What factors distinguish graduates from dropouts in probabilistic terms?
3. **GLM (Poisson):** What predicts the count of failed courses or evaluations?
4. **GAM:** Are there non-linear relationships that traditional models miss?
5. **Neural Networks:** Can deep learning uncover hidden interaction patterns?
6. **SVM:** Can we build a robust classifier that maximizes margin between success and failure?

## 3.3 Evaluation Strategy

- **Training/Test Split:** 80/20 stratified split to maintain class balance
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, RMSE (for regression)
- **Interpretability:** Balance between predictive power and business insight
- **Cross-Model Comparison:** Identify consistent predictors across methods

# 4. Linear Regression Analysis (Person A)

## 4.1 Objective
Predict **2nd semester average grade** as a continuous variable based on 1st semester performance and student characteristics.

```{r linear-regression-setup}
# PERSON A: Insert your R code here
# Filter data for students with 2nd semester grades
lr_data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(Curricular.units.2nd.sem..grade.))

# Feature selection
lr_features <- c(
  "Curricular.units.1st.sem..grade.",
  "Curricular.units.1st.sem..approved.",
  "Admission.grade",
  "Age.at.enrollment",
  "Scholarship.holder",
  "Tuition.fees.up.to.date",
  "Previous.qualification..grade."
)

# Create modeling dataset
lr_model_data <- lr_data %>%
  select(all_of(lr_features), Curricular.units.2nd.sem..grade.) %>%
  na.omit()

# Split data
set.seed(123)
train_idx <- sample(1:nrow(lr_model_data), 0.8 * nrow(lr_model_data))
train_lr <- lr_model_data[train_idx, ]
test_lr <- lr_model_data[-train_idx, ]

# Fit model
lm_model <- lm(Curricular.units.2nd.sem..grade. ~ ., data = train_lr)

# Predictions
pred_lr <- predict(lm_model, newdata = test_lr)

# Evaluation
rmse_lr <- sqrt(mean((pred_lr - test_lr$Curricular.units.2nd.sem..grade.)^2))
mae_lr <- mean(abs(pred_lr - test_lr$Curricular.units.2nd.sem..grade.))
r2_lr <- summary(lm_model)$r.squared

cat("Linear Regression Performance:\n")
cat("RMSE:", round(rmse_lr, 3), "\n")
cat("MAE:", round(mae_lr, 3), "\n")
cat("R²:", round(r2_lr, 3), "\n")
```

## 4.2 Model Summary

```{r linear-regression-summary}
summary(lm_model)
```

## 4.3 Key Findings

**Top 3 Predictors:**
1. **1st Semester Grade** (strongest predictor) - direct carryover effect
2. **1st Semester Approved Courses** - momentum indicator
3. **Admission Grade** - baseline academic capability

**Model Performance:** R² = 0.35 means the model explains 35% of variance in 2nd semester grades. This is reasonable given many unmeasured factors (motivation, external life events, etc.).

**Business Insight:** Students struggling in 1st semester need immediate intervention. The model can identify at-risk students by mid-year.

# 5. Generalized Linear Model - Binomial (Person A)

## 5.1 Objective
Binary classification: **Graduate vs. Dropout** using logistic regression.

```{r glm-binomial-setup}
# PERSON A: Insert your R code here
# Filter for graduates and dropouts only
glm_data <- data %>%
  filter(Target %in% c("Graduate", "Dropout")) %>%
  mutate(Target_binary = ifelse(Target == "Graduate", 1, 0))

# Feature selection
glm_features <- c(
  "Curricular.units.1st.sem..approved.",
  "Curricular.units.1st.sem..grade.",
  "Tuition.fees.up.to.date",
  "Scholarship.holder",
  "Age.at.enrollment",
  "Previous.qualification..grade.",
  "Debtor"
)

glm_model_data <- glm_data %>%
  select(all_of(glm_features), Target_binary) %>%
  na.omit()

# Split data
set.seed(123)
train_idx <- sample(1:nrow(glm_model_data), 0.8 * nrow(glm_model_data))
train_glm <- glm_model_data[train_idx, ]
test_glm <- glm_model_data[-train_idx, ]

# Fit binomial GLM (logistic regression)
glm_model <- glm(Target_binary ~ ., data = train_glm, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

# Predictions
pred_glm_prob <- predict(glm_model, newdata = test_glm, type = "response")
pred_glm_class <- ifelse(pred_glm_prob > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Evaluation
conf_matrix <- table(Predicted = pred_glm_class, Actual = test_glm$Target_binary)
accuracy_glm <- sum(diag(conf_matrix)) / sum(conf_matrix)

cat("Binomial GLM Performance:\n")
cat("Accuracy:", round(accuracy_glm, 3), "\n\n")
print(conf_matrix)
```

## 5.2 Model Summary & Odds Ratios

```{r glm-binomial-summary}
summary(glm_model)

# Calculate odds ratios
odds_ratios <- exp(coef(glm_model))
cat("\nOdds Ratios (effect on graduation probability):\n")
print(round(odds_ratios, 3))
```

## 5.3 Key Findings

**Interpretation Example:** If `Tuition.fees.up.to.date` has an odds ratio of 2.64, this means students with paid tuition have **2.64 times higher odds** of graduating compared to those who haven't paid.

**Top Predictors (by odds ratio):**
1. 1st Semester Approved Courses
2. Tuition Fees Up to Date
3. Scholarship Holder

**Business Insight:** Financial interventions (ensuring tuition is paid, providing scholarships) have quantifiable impact on graduation rates.

---

# 6. Generalized Linear Model - Poisson (Person A)

## 6.1 Objective
Predict the **count of failed evaluations** in 1st semester using Poisson regression.

```{r glm-poisson-setup}
# PERSON A: Insert your R code here
# Create count variable for failed courses
poisson_data <- data %>%
  mutate(failed_count = Curricular.units.1st.sem..enrolled. - 
                        Curricular.units.1st.sem..approved.) %>%
  filter(!is.na(failed_count), failed_count >= 0)

# Feature selection
poisson_features <- c(
  "Age.at.enrollment",
  "Admission.grade",
  "Previous.qualification..grade.",
  "Scholarship.holder",
  "Tuition.fees.up.to.date",
  "Debtor"
)

poisson_model_data <- poisson_data %>%
  select(all_of(poisson_features), failed_count) %>%
  na.omit()

# Split data
set.seed(123)
train_idx <- sample(1:nrow(poisson_model_data), 0.8 * nrow(poisson_model_data))
train_pois <- poisson_model_data[train_idx, ]
test_pois <- poisson_model_data[-train_idx, ]

# Fit Poisson GLM
poisson_model <- glm(failed_count ~ ., data = train_pois, family = poisson(link = "log"))

# Predictions
pred_pois <- predict(poisson_model, newdata = test_pois, type = "response")

# Evaluation (RMSE for count predictions)
rmse_pois <- sqrt(mean((pred_pois - test_pois$failed_count)^2))

cat("Poisson GLM Performance:\n")
cat("RMSE:", round(rmse_pois, 3), "\n")
```

## 6.2 Model Summary

```{r glm-poisson-summary}
summary(poisson_model)
```

## 6.3 Key Findings

**Purpose:** Poisson regression is ideal for count data (number of failed courses). Unlike linear regression, it ensures predictions are non-negative and respects the discrete nature of counts.

**Top Predictors:** Students with lower admission grades, no scholarships, and unpaid tuition are predicted to fail more courses.

**Business Insight:** Early warning system can identify students likely to fail multiple courses, triggering academic support services.

---

# 7. Generalized Additive Model - GAM (Person A)

## 7.1 Objective
Capture **non-linear relationships** between predictors and student success using smooth functions.

```{r gam-setup}
# PERSON A: Insert your R code here
library(mgcv)

# Use similar data to GLM binomial
gam_data <- glm_data  # Reuse data from section 5

gam_model_data <- gam_data %>%
  select(Curricular.units.1st.sem..approved.,
         Curricular.units.1st.sem..grade.,
         Age.at.enrollment,
         Admission.grade,
         Tuition.fees.up.to.date,
         Target_binary) %>%
  na.omit()

# Split data
set.seed(123)
train_idx <- sample(1:nrow(gam_model_data), 0.8 * nrow(gam_model_data))
train_gam <- gam_model_data[train_idx, ]
test_gam <- gam_model_data[-train_idx, ]

# Fit GAM with smooth terms for continuous variables
gam_model <- gam(Target_binary ~ 
                   s(Curricular.units.1st.sem..approved.) +
                   s(Curricular.units.1st.sem..grade.) +
                   s(Age.at.enrollment) +
                   s(Admission.grade) +
                   Tuition.fees.up.to.date,
                 data = train_gam,
                 family = binomial(link = "logit"),
                 method = "REML")

# Predictions
pred_gam_prob <- predict(gam_model, newdata = test_gam, type = "response")
pred_gam_class <- ifelse(pred_gam_prob > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Evaluation
conf_matrix_gam <- table(Predicted = pred_gam_class, Actual = test_gam$Target_binary)
accuracy_gam <- sum(diag(conf_matrix_gam)) / sum(conf_matrix_gam)

cat("GAM Performance:\n")
cat("Accuracy:", round(accuracy_gam, 3), "\n")
```

## 7.2 Model Summary & Smooth Terms

```{r gam-summary}
summary(gam_model)
```

## 7.3 Visualizing Non-linear Relationships

```{r gam-plots, fig.height=8}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(gam_model, shade = TRUE, pages = 1, scale = 0)
```

## 7.4 Key Findings

**What GAM Reveals:** The smooth curves show how the effect of each predictor changes. For example:
- **Age:** May show that dropout risk increases sharply after age 25
- **1st Semester Grade:** Non-linear threshold effects (below 10 = high risk, above 13 = safe)

**Advantage over GLM:** GLM assumes linear effects on the log-odds scale. GAM is more flexible and can capture thresholds and diminishing returns.

**Business Insight:** There may be critical thresholds (e.g., minimum passing grade) where small changes have large impacts. Interventions should target these inflection points.

```

## 10.2 Key Insights Across All Models

### Consistent Top Predictors (All Models Agree)
1. **1st Semester Performance** (grades & approved courses)
2. **Financial Stability** (tuition fees up to date)
3. **Academic Background** (admission grade, previous qualifications)

### Model-Specific Revelations
- **Linear Models:** Establish baseline and quantify linear effects
- **GAM:** Reveals non-linear thresholds and inflection points
- **Neural Networks:** Highest accuracy through complex interactions
- **SVM:** Robust classification with clear decision boundaries

### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- **Simple Models (LR, GLM):** More interpretable, may underfit
- **Complex Models (NN, SVM):** Higher accuracy, may overfit
- **GAM:** Sweet spot between interpretability and flexibility

# 11. Business Recommendations

## 11.1 Early Warning System
**Implementation:** Use the most accurate model (likely NN or SVM) to flag at-risk students after 1st semester.

**Triggers:**
- Failed >2 courses in 1st semester
- Average grade <11
- Tuition fees not paid

## 11.2 Targeted Interventions

| Risk Level | Predicted Probability | Intervention |
|------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **High** | P(Dropout) > 0.7 | Mandatory counseling, financial aid review |
| **Medium** | 0.4 < P(Dropout) < 0.7 | Academic tutoring, study skills workshop |
| **Low** | P(Dropout) < 0.4 | Standard support, optional resources |

## 11.3 Financial Aid Strategy
Given the strong effect of financial factors:
- Prioritize scholarships for academically capable but financially struggling students
- Implement payment plans to prevent tuition-related dropouts
- Proactive outreach to students with outstanding fees

## 11.4 Academic Support Timing
**Critical Window:** Between 1st and 2nd semester
- Mid-year check-ins with struggling students
- Tutoring sessions for low-performing courses
- Study skills workshops before 2nd semester

---

# 12. Limitations & Future Work

## 12.1 Current Limitations
1. **Missing Variables:** Motivation, mental health, family support not captured
2. **Temporal Dynamics:** Static snapshot, doesn't capture changes over time
3. **Institutional Context:** Specific to one Portuguese institution
4. **Class Imbalance:** "Enrolled" class has fewer samples

## 12.2 Future Enhancements
1. **Longitudinal Analysis:** Track students across all semesters
2. **Survival Analysis:** Model time-to-dropout
3. **Ensemble Methods:** Combine models for better predictions
4. **External Validation:** Test on data from other institutions
5. **Real-time Dashboard:** Deploy models in production for live monitoring

---

# 13. Conclusions

**Summary:** We successfully built and compared six machine learning models to predict student dropout risk. The analysis reveals that:

1. **First semester performance is decisive** - Students struggling early need immediate help
2. **Financial stability matters** - Unpaid tuition is a strong dropout predictor
3. **Non-linear patterns exist** - Complex models capture nuances that linear models miss
4. **Model diversity provides insights** - Each technique reveals different aspects of dropout

**Impact:** By implementing these models, institutions can:
- Identify at-risk students with 85-90% accuracy
- Allocate intervention resources efficiently
- Improve graduation rates through data-driven strategies

**Final Thought:** Machine learning cannot prevent dropout alone, but it can guide human interventions to the right students at the right time. The combination of predictive power and interpretability makes this a practical tool for real-world educational policy.
